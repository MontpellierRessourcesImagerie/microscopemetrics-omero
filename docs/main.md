Points to handle

## How is the data organized?
We follow ISA model. https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
- **Investigation**: is the group level. That is the microscope
- **Study**: is the type of analysis. This is probably ambiguous. 
  - What is the analysis? a sample or an analysis. 
    For example, for the argolight you may measure in the same sample
    the horizontal resolution and the vertical resolution.
- **Assay**: is the actual measurement. I would say the time point in the data series.
